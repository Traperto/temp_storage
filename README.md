#  temp_storage
_A simple storage for temperature and humidity data which can be accessed via REST-API_

## Get this to run
- Make sure that _node_ is installed on your machine
- Copy the file _src/.environment.ts.example_ to _src/.environment.ts_ and fill it with your data. (If the _sqlite.path_ does not exist, it will be created with all necessary tables automatically)
- Run `npm run-script start` to start the server 

Done.
